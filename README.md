# Rusty RogueLike
### Story
The hero’s hometown is suffering from a plague of monsters. Welling up from the deep,
they seem unstoppable. Legend tells of the Amulet of Yala - Yet Another Lost Amulet -
that can be used to stem the tide. After a long night at the tavern, the hero promises to
save the day - and sets forth into the dungeon.
### Basic game loops
1. Enter dungeon level.
2. Explore, revealing the map.
3. Encounter enemies whom the player fights or flees from.
4. Find power-ups and use them to strengthen the player.
5. Locate the exit to the level - go to 1.
